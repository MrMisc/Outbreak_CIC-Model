## Space
- RESTRICTION: true (Are the hosts restricted to segments within each zone)
- INFECTION PROBABILITIES PER ZONE: [0.9, 0.9] (Probability of transfer of salmonella per zone)
- CONTACT TRANSMISSION PROBABILITIES PER ZONE: [0.625, 0.625] (Probability of transfer of salmonella per zone)
- GRIDSIZE: [[168000.0, 4.0, 4.0], [28000.0, 2.0, 2.0]] (Size of the grid)
- MAX_MOVE: 10 (Maximum move value)
- MEAN_MOVE: 4 (Mean move value)
- STD_MOVE: 3 (Standard deviation of move value)
- MAX_MOVE_Z: 1 (Maximum move for vertical motion)
- MEAN_MOVE_Z: 2 (Mean move value for vertical motion)
- STD_MOVE_Z: 4 (Standard deviation of move value for vertical motion)
- FAECAL DROP: false (Does faeces potentially fall between segments downwards?)
- PROBABILITY OF FAECAL DROP: 0.3 (If yes, what is the probability? -> Poisson hourly rate)
- TRANSMISSION BETWEEN ZONES disabled: [true, false] (Can diseases transfer between segments/cages within each zone?)

## Flight module
- FLY: false (Flight module enabled/disabled)

## Perching module
- PERCH: false (Do the hosts perch?)

## Eviscerator Configuration enabled:true
- Evisceration Zones: [1]
- NUMBER OF EVISCERATORS PROBES: [28]
- NUMBER OF EVISCERATOR MACHINES (each containing said amount of probes above): 2
- EVISCERATOR DECAY: 5 (Number of hosts an eviscerator has to go through before the infection is gone)
- MISHAP: true (Can hosts explode by accident during evisceration??)
- MISHAP_PROBABILITY: 0.01 (At what probability does this accident happen??)
- MISHAP_RADIUS: 10 (At what radius does this explosion occur - (currently fixed radius)??)

## Transfer Configuration
- Times Manual Map: [0.01, 1.0] (Times that hosts have to spend in each zone)
- Influx?: false (Did the simulation bring in hosts to process?)
- If yes, they were brought in every 2 hours
- Period of transport rules : 1 hours (How many hours until we check to see if hosts need to be moved from zone to zone)

## Disease
- TRANSFER_DISTANCE: 1 (Maximum distance for disease transmission)

## Collection
- AGE_OF_HOSTCOLLECTION: 20 days
- AGE_OF_DEPOSITCOLLECTION: 1 days
- FAECAL_CLEANUP_FREQUENCY: 12 times per day

## Resolution
- STEP: [[4, 4, 4], [2, 2, 2]] (hosts per unit distance)
- HOUR_STEP: 4 (hosts move per hour)
- LENGTH: 20 (Simulation duration in hours)

## Generation
- SPORADICITY: 1000 ( Bigger number makes the spread of hosts starting point more even per seg)

##Contamination Pathway Toolbox options
HOSTTOHOST_CONTACT_SPREAD: false ( Whether contamination can spread from mobile host to mobile host)
HOSTTOEGG_CONTACT_SPREAD: true ( Whether contamination can spread from mobile host to edible/consumable deposit from host)
HOSTTOFAECES_CONTACT_SPREAD: false ( Whether contamination can spread from mobile host to inedible/non-consumable deposit from host - i.e. faecal matter)
EGGTOFAECES_CONTACT_SPREAD: true ( Whether contamination can spread from edible/consumable deposit from host to inedible/non-consumable deposit from host)
FAECESTOEGG_CONTACT_SPREAD: true ( Whether contamination can spread from inedible/non-consumable deposit from host to edible/consumable deposit from host)
FAECESTOHOST_CONTACT_SPREAD: true ( Whether contamination can spread from inedible/non-consumable deposit from host to mobile host)
