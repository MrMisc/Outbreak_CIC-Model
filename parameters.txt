## Space
- RESTRICTION: true (Are the hosts restricted to segments within each zone)
- LISTOFPROBABILITIES: [0.1, 0.1, 0.1] (Probability of transfer of salmonella per zone)
- GRIDSIZE: [[960.0, 4.0, 4.0], [960.0, 4.0, 4.0], [960.0, 4.0, 4.0]] (Size of the grid)
- MAX_MOVE: 1 (Maximum move value)
- MEAN_MOVE: 0.5 (Mean move value)
- STD_MOVE: 1 (Standard deviation of move value)
- MAX_MOVE_Z: 1 (Maximum move for vertical motion)
- MEAN_MOVE_Z: 2 (Mean move value for vertical motion)
- STD_MOVE_Z: 4 (Standard deviation of move value for vertical motion)
- FAECAL DROP: false (Does faeces potentially fall between segments downwards?)
- PROBABILITY OF FAECAL DROP: 0.3 (If yes, what is the probability? -> Poisson hourly rate)
- TRANSMISSION BETWEEN ZONES disabled: [false, false, false] (Can diseases transfer between segments/cages within each zone?)

## Flight module
- FLY: false (Flight module enabled/disabled)
- FLY_FREQ: 3 (Frequency of flight - which HOUR STEP do the hosts land, if at all)

## Eviscerator Configuration enabled:false
- Evisceration Zones: [2]
- NUMBER OF EVISCERATORS: [6]
- EVISCERATOR DECAY: 5 (Number of hosts an eviscerator has to go through before the infection is gone)
- MISHAP: false (Can hosts explode by accident during evisceration??)
- MISHAP_PROBABILITY: 0.01 (At what probability does this accident happen??)
- MISHAP_RADIUS: 9 (At what radius does this explosion occur - (currently fixed radius)??)

## Transfer Configuration
- Times Manual Map: [24.0, 24.0, 12.0] (Times that hosts have to spend in each zone)
- Influx?: false (Did the simulation bring in hosts to process?)
- If yes, they were brought in every 24 hours
- Period of transport rules : 1 hours (How many hours until we check to see if hosts need to be moved from zone to zone)

## Disease
- TRANSFER_DISTANCE: 1.3 (Maximum distance for disease transmission)

## Collection
- AGE_OF_HOSTCOLLECTION: 20 days
- AGE_OF_DEPOSITCOLLECTION: 1 days
- FAECAL_CLEANUP_FREQUENCY: 12 times per day

## Resolution
- STEP: [[4, 4, 4], [4, 4, 4], [4, 4, 4]] (hosts per unit distance)
- HOUR_STEP: 4 (hosts move per hour)
- LENGTH: 72 (Simulation duration in hours)

## Generation
- SPORADICITY: 4 ( Bigger number makes the spread of hosts starting point more even per seg)
